1. #include directives start with standard library ones(if any), followed by user-defined headers. The same goes for modules.
2. Program components are logically grouped with directories. In directories, different words are separated with one space, each word 
starts with an uppercase letter. Namespaces replicate the directory structure: everything is in lowercase, spaces are replaced with an underscore.
3. There must be no classes, structures, functions, ... in global namespace. The only exceptions are: main, exported functions and classes.
Exported in this context means exported through boundaries of one binary (.exe, .dll, etc) to another, this does not cover C++ modules.
4. There must be no nested classes, structures, ... The only exceptions are: type aliases, templates. Inside the class declarations and
definitions should (not required) be in the following order: public, protected, private; fields, constructors, methods, overloads, friend functions, destructors.
5. Only one class, structure, enum, etc per header file. Header file's guard consists of (project_name)_(namespace path)_(name of the class, ...).
6. Source Files must be placed in a directory called "Implementation" for each directory that contains header files.
7. Each directory is its own module. Primary module interface unit must contain no declarations and definitions, except module definition and 
'export import's. Effectively, primary module interface unit aggregates all module elements that are considered to be a part of its public interface.
The name of the primary module interface unit must start with "Export".
8. Each class, structure, etc. is its own module partition, which contains both declaration and definition. (not required) Similar functions that are not part of any
class must be grouped with a class that treats these functions as its public static methods. The same goes for global variables.
9. All #includes for header files (libraries that do not support modules) must be within global module segment (if file is a module interface definition). Like this:
''''
module;

#includes

export module MODULE;
''''
10. Snake case is used for all identifiers. Type aliases must end with "_type", template parameters must end with "_type". "{" must be on the same line as the declaration.
Template template arguments must end with "_template".
